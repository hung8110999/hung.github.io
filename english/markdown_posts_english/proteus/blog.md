# Proteus: Exploring Protein Structure Generation for Enhanced Designability and Efficiency
Since this is my first academic paper, I thought it would be easier to start with an article I've already researched and found quite impressive. Besides, I think that because I'll be encountering many international concepts, I'll use English in my academic writing.

## 1. Basic Concepts
### 1.1 What made protein ?
**Amino Acids**

I'll start with this, amino acids. It is the building blocks of proteins (of course there's a lot of concept that smaller than this, but I think this level is enough to understand this paper). 

So what is the amino acids, for those who studied in Vietnam, you may know this concept from high school chemistry, specifically, it is the third or fourth lesson in the chemistry textbook for 12th grade.

Amino acids are the molecules that contain both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxyl group (-COOH). In the center of the molecule, there is a carbon atom called the alpha-carbon, which is bonded to the amino group, the carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and a side chain (R-group), that are making the different between amino acids.

We have 22 different amino acids, and they are making the different between proteins. Once again, if you are (or were) a Vietnamese student, you may remember the nam GLY, ALA, or VAL, that is the abbreviation of amino acids.

**Protein**
From the basic concept of amino acids above, we continue to Protein, which basically is the chain of amino acids.

Yeah, it is that simple. But the problem is that the protein is not just a straight chain of amino acids. It is a 3D structure that is folded in a specific way. So the next question is, how does the protein fold into a 3D structure?

**Protein Folding**
The protein folding is the process by which a protein folds into its 3D structure. Present into 4 levels:
1. Primary structure: The sequence of amino acids.
2. Secondary structure: The local folding of the protein, such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets.
3. Tertiary structure: The overall 3D structure of the protein.
4. Quaternary structure: The structure of the protein when it is composed of multiple polypeptide chains.
